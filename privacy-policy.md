# Privacy Policy

We take privacy seriously. This policy covers how we handle information collected by the ChatGPT Lightspeed Keyboard chrome extension.

## Information Collection and Use

The extension does not collect or transmit any user information. It works locally by injecting code into the ChatGPT site to click interface buttons on your behalf to switch models or interrupt output.

The extension requires the ‘activeTab’ and ‘scripting’ permissions in order to function:

 - `activeTab` allows querying the currently active browser tab id so the extension can target its actions only when the user is using the ChatGPT tab
 - `scripting` allows injecting a content script to automate clicking the 'Stop generating' button

No user data, browsing history, or other personal information leaves your browser. The extension solely leverages Chrome APIs to manipulate the ChatGPT site faster using keyboard shortcuts.

## Information Sharing

No information is transmitted externally to any servers. Everything occurs entirely client-side within your browser.

The extension is open-source so interested users can verify exactly what it does by reviewing the code on GitHub at [https://github.com/jboesen/chatgpt-lightspeed-keyboard] (i.e., this repository).

## Privacy Policy Changes

If any changes to data collection or sharing occur in the future, this privacy policy will be updated to reflect those changes prior to release.
